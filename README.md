# Summary
Raspberry Pi (A/B/2) Python Camera script with it's focus on image quality, automation and an easy setup.

# What works
Picam.py
- Takes images based on motion detection
- Automatically changes day/night settings based on your local sunset/sunrise

In combination with the storageController.sh script:
- The picam.py script writes the images to a 32 MB RAMdisk for optimal speed
- Images on the RAMdisk are moved to a network folder, parallel to the pycam.py still shooting images.
- Checks are made to make sure the network location is online. If the network location goes down, images are temporary written to a folder on the SD card until the network folder is back online.

You don't need both scripts, Picam.py can easily run on it's own and write the images to a folder. 

# ToDo
The script is still in the works, but a lot planned:
- Optimal dynamic motion detection level
- Camera LED on/off during the night/day
- Easy installer (although the scripts isn't hard to install..)
- Website to manage the script / see the recently taken images.
See the issues list for full details.

# How to install
Make sure you have a Raspberry Pi with the camera addon and a fully updated Raspbian OS. Enable the camera addon in Raspbian:
```
sudo raspi-config
```
Select Enable camera and hit Enter, then go to Finish and you'll be prompted to reboot.
Also make sure that you've set 128MB RAM for the GPU.

Install Astral (used for the sunset/sunrise, https://pythonhosted.org/astral)
```
sudo pip install astral
```

Install Screen
```
sudo apt-get install screen
```

Open the picam.py and storageController.sh scripts with a text editor like Nano and edit the values you'd need.

Run the scripts, preferrable in Screen. Start with the storageController.sh as this first needs to create the ramdisk
```
sudo screen sh storageController.sh
sudo screen python picam.py
```
And ALT-D yourself out of the screen shell and see the images come in on your NAS
