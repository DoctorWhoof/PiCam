# Summary
PiCam script with focus on image quality, easy setup and a lot of (automatic) functions.

# What works
- Takes images based on motion detection
- Automatically changes day/night settings based on your local sunset/sunrise

# ToDo
The script is still in the works, but a lot is coming:
- Optimal dynamic motion detection level
- Camera LED on/off during the night/day
- Easy installer (although the script isn't hard to install..)
- Website to manage the script / see the recently taken images.
- Multithreading

See the issues list for full details.
